* I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [School of Social Work](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/ssw/) at the [University of Minnesota Twin Cities](https://www.umn.edu/), with a minor in Biostatistics. 
* My research interests included long-term services and supports in community settings, mental health among older adults, and program evaluation and assessment. 
* My dissertation research focuses on the environmental impacts on the cognitive trajectories among older adults in China and the US. 
* Top three favorite things to do when I am not working: Spending time with my partner, watching basketball games, and eating a whole pizza. Sorry daugther, you didn't make it to the top three list. Maybe top ten?
