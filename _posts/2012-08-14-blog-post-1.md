This is something I did years ago for my SSWR presentation. Basically, I wanted to create a map to show the location of the universities that were hiring social work faculty. One way I could create such a map was to find a US map and put the dots on the map myself, but that was tedious. So, I tried to do this in R. After googling around for a while, I found out it was very easy to do.

This time, I want to do something different. Say I want to map the top 100 public high schools in the United State. [Download the dataset here](https://github.com/zhmy89/mypersonalweb/blob/master/_posts/zhmy89.github.io/mypersonalweb/files/hs.csv)

## Preparation 
Here are the packages that I will need.

    library(ggplot2)
    library(fiftystater)
    library(ggmap)


Note: If you don't have the packages, use `install.packages("nameofthepackage")` to install the package (e.g. `install.packages('ggplot2')`. Some of you may have a hard time installing the package "fiftystater", you can use this line of code: `devtools::install_github("dkahle/ggmap")`

    hs <- read.csv("hs.csv") # load the dataset
    head(hs) # display the first 6 rows of the dataset
    
 |ID|Rank|Enrollment|School|Location|
 | ---| ------ | -- | -- | -- |
|1|1|14,153|Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow|Columbus, OH|
|2|2|13,916|Georgia Cyber Academy|Atlanta, GA|
|3|3|11,372|Noble Street Charter Schools|Chicago, IL|
|4|4|9,466|Ohio Virtual Academy|Maumee, OH|
|5|5|9,058|Pennsylvania Cyber Cs|Midland, PA|
|6|6|8,877|Commonwealth Connections Academy Cs|Harrisburg, PA|
    
    
## Generating latitude and longitude

As you can see, I only have the name of the schools in the dataset. I will need their latitudes and longitudes to pinpoint them on the map. Of course, I don't want to enter each latitude and longitude manually. Again, I am lazy. So I will use the pacage, ggmap (author: David Kahle david.kahle@gmail.com). 

NOTE: We will need an API key to use google service in this step. Here the link to apply: [link](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/#get-started). 

Once you have the key, run this code

    google_key(copy and paste your API key here)
    # now you can use google service through ggmap. 
    
    hs$School <- as.character.factor(hs$School) 
    # Need to change the name of the schools to "character" so that ggmap can read.
    data("fifty_states") # load dataset fifty_states to draw a US map.
    hs_geo <- mutate_geocode(hs,School, source = "google") # use google service
    # The line of code wiill create a new dataset that incldues the latitude and longitude for each school 
    # What this line of code does is to gather the location information by searching on Google server using the name of the school.
    


 |ID|Rank|Enrollment|School|Location|lon|lat|
 | ---| ------ | -- | -- | -- |-- | -- |
|1 | 1|   14,153|    Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow|   Columbus, OH| -82.99854 |39.88650|
|  2|    2 |    13,916|               Georgia Cyber Academy|    Atlanta, GA| -84.44624| 33.61567|
| 3 |   3  |   11,372 |       Noble Street Charter Schools |   Chicago, IL| -87.62725| 41.88241|
| 4  |  4   |   9,466  |              Ohio Virtual Academy |   Maumee, OH| -83.68418| 41.58705|

| 6    |6     | 8,877 |Commonwealth Connections Academy Cs |Harrisburg, PA| -76.88340| 40.29274 |   
    
    
    
    ggplot() 
    + geom_polygon(data=fifty_states, aes(x=long, y=lat, group = group),color="black", fill="grey92" )
    # this help me to draw a US map. 
    # color is the color of the map. 
    + geom_point(data=locations_df, aes(x=lon, y=lat), color = "red", size = 1)
    # this help me to pinpoint the location of the schools based on the latitude and longitude.
    # color is the color of the dots
    # size means the size of the points. We can change it to size =2 or larger numbers.

Now you have it! Of course, there are many things we can do to make the map looks nicer. But we will settle with what we have for now.
